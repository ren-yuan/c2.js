# [c2.js](http://c2js.org)

c2.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding based on computational geometry, physics simulation, evolutionary algorithm and other modules.

c2.js is written in TypeScript, developed using object-oriented technology, and finally released as a JavaScript library. It provides many useful algorithms that can be applied to generative design, data visualization, and sound visualization.

c2.js is computationally focused, and generates geometric data through the algorithm module provided. Currently it only provides a simple Renderer class based on Canvas for rendering. You can implement your own renderer based on Canvas, SVG, or WebGL according to your needs, or use existing libraries.
